INFO (VLOGNET-188): While generating implicit netlist, it is recommended to set
the Terminal SyncUp option on the Netlist Setup form as 'Honor Switch
Master'.
Alternatively, you can set the hnlVerilogTermSyncUp variable as
'honorSM'.
This option automatically resolves any mismatch between the terminals
of an instance and its switch master while generating an implicit netlist.

INFO (VLOGNET-60): The stimulus name mapped table will not be printed in the

"/home/arpanr2/ece425.work/MUX2-1_run1/testfixture.verilog" file. To print the
stimulus name mapped table, set 
simVerilogPrintStimulusNameMappingTable = t
either in CIW or the .simrc file 
before invoking Verilog netlister.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-62): Database internal net names will be printed for floating
instance ports. To prevent 
them from being printed, set
simVerilogProcessNullPorts = t either in CIW or 
the .simrc file.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-64): All cellviews in the design will be printed in the Netlist
Configuration list. 
If you want to print only those cellviews that need to be
re-netlisted in the 
list, set simVerilogIncrementalNetlistConfigList = t either
in CIW or the 
.simrc file.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-66): Module ports will be printed without the port ranges. If you
have split busses 
across module ports you may get an incorrect netlist. To
print module ports 
with the port ranges, set simVerilogDropPortRange = nil
either in CIW or the 
.simrc file.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-68): The initial state of stimulus of all inout pins is set to
"z". To get inout 
pins with initial state of "0", set
hnlVerilogIOInitStimulusStr = "0" 
either in CIW or the .simrc file.
 
INFO (OSSHNL-287): Cadence model name
edits/MUX2-1/schematic 
is illegal in
target tool name space; It requires mapping. However using the
name map rules
given, the netlister cannot generate a name which is within the
maximum length
limit of this name type. The candidate name is
edits_MUX2-1_schematic 
Of length
22, exceeding the limit for an internal name of a model of 16 computed from
hnlMaxModelNameLength=<unspecified> which can override hnlMaxNameLength=16.
To
avoid this try one of the following
1. Modify the name as per the name length
limit.
2. Turn off 'Support Escaped Names', so that the netlister could
automatically
map the long name to a short name.
3. Modify the name length OSS
variable(s) to increase the name length limit.
