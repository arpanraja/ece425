Begin Incremental Netlisting May  1 16:10:46 2023
WARNING (OSSHNL-143): Incremental netlisting is not possible since the global
map file '/home/arpanr2/ece425.work/datapath_run1/ihnl/globalmap', could
not be
opened in the read mode for IHNL version number comparison.
Therefore
re-netlisting the entire design.

si: simSetDef().... hnlMaxNameLength is already set to 16. Redefinition to 50 is
ignored.
si: simSetDef().... hnlCapability is initialized to "nil".
si: simSetDef().... hnlBusCapability is initialized to "nil".
INFO (VLOGNET-188): While generating implicit netlist, it is recommended to set
the Terminal SyncUp option on the Netlist Setup form as 'Honor Switch
Master'.
Alternatively, you can set the hnlVerilogTermSyncUp variable as
'honorSM'.
This option automatically resolves any mismatch between the terminals
of an instance and its switch master while generating an implicit netlist.

INFO (VLOGNET-60): The stimulus name mapped table will not be printed in the

"/home/arpanr2/ece425.work/datapath_run1/testfixture.verilog" file. To print
the stimulus name mapped table, set 
simVerilogPrintStimulusNameMappingTable = t
either in CIW or the .simrc file 
before invoking Verilog netlister.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-62): Database internal net names will be printed for floating
instance ports. To prevent 
them from being printed, set
simVerilogProcessNullPorts = t either in CIW or 
the .simrc file.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-64): All cellviews in the design will be printed in the Netlist
Configuration list. 
If you want to print only those cellviews that need to be
re-netlisted in the 
list, set simVerilogIncrementalNetlistConfigList = t either
in CIW or the 
.simrc file.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-66): Module ports will be printed without the port ranges. If you
have split busses 
across module ports you may get an incorrect netlist. To
print module ports 
with the port ranges, set simVerilogDropPortRange = nil
either in CIW or the 
.simrc file.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-68): The initial state of stimulus of all inout pins is set to
"z". To get inout 
pins with initial state of "0", set
hnlVerilogIOInitStimulusStr = "0" 
either in CIW or the .simrc file.
 
WARNING (OSSHNL-117): Ignoring switch view 'schematic' of cell 'gnd' in library
'basic', as it does not contain
any instance. To netlist this cell, add this
switch view to the stop list or to
ignore any specific instance set the property
'nlAction' to value "ignore" on
this cell view.

WARNING (OSSHNL-117): Ignoring switch view 'schematic' of cell 'vdd' in library
'basic', as it does not contain
any instance. To netlist this cell, add this
switch view to the stop list or to
ignore any specific instance set the property
'nlAction' to value "ignore" on
this cell view.

INFO (OSSHNL-287): Cadence model name
ece425mp2/MUX2-1/schematic 
is illegal in
target tool name space; It requires mapping. However using the
name map rules
given, the netlister cannot generate a name which is within the
maximum length
limit of this name type. The candidate name is
ece425mp2_MUX2-1_schematic 
Of
length 26, exceeding the limit for an internal name of a model of 16 computed
from hnlMaxModelNameLength=<unspecified> which can override
hnlMaxNameLength=16.
To avoid this try one of the following
1. Modify the name
as per the name length limit.
2. Turn off 'Support Escaped Names', so that the
netlister could automatically
map the long name to a short name.
3. Modify the
name length OSS variable(s) to increase the name length limit.
